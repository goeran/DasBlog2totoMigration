Yesterday everything fell into place, and I can now announce that I’m onboard the program. I’m up for a two year period; 2009 and 2010. </p>  <p>It’s an honor for me to join the program. There are about 120-130 Regional Directors worldwide. In Norway we are now 4 Regional Directors – my friends <a href="http://jonas.follesoe.no" target="_blank">Jonas</a> and <a href="http://www.sondreb.com" target="_blank">Sondre</a>, Trond Brande and me.</p>  <p><a href="http://jonas.follesoe.no/ItsOfficialImNowAMicrosoftRegionalDirector.aspx" target="_blank">Like Jonas said</a> when he joined; it feels strange to become a member of such a highly qualified and experienced group of people. Many people in this group are well known technical speakers and book authors. I’m sure I’ll grow with the new responsibilities, and that I’m able to contribute to the group. I’ll continue to work hard on evangelizing Microsoft technologies and software development best practices to the community. This is definitely a motivational boost for me!</p>  <p>I would like to say thank you to Microsoft Norway and <a href="http://twitter.com/grothaug" target="_blank">Rune Grothaug</a> for making this happen.</p>  <h3>What is a Microsoft Regional Director?</h3>  <blockquote>   <p>“The Microsoft Regional Director (RD) program is a community of independent developers, architects, trainers, and other professionals who form a vital link between Microsoft and the developer community. These technical experts provide insight and informed perspectives about Microsoft software development tools and technologies. Regional Directors are not Microsoft employees, nor are they monetarily-compensated by Microsoft. They are recognized by Microsoft for their technical expertise. Many Regional Directors are also Microsoft MVPs.” – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Regional_Director" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>
