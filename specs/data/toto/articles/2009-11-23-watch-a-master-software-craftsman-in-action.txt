<p>If you read my blog or if you know me personally, you know I'm a big fan of <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html" target="_blank">Unclebob</a>. The reason I admire him is simple: he is a major contributor to the developer community. He writes <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/books.html" target="_blank">books</a> and <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/books.html" target="_blank">articles</a>, speaks at conferences and contributes to <a href="http://fitnesse.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Software</a>. It inspires me to see that he still have a glowing passion for software development, even though it has been his labor for 35 years. It's the same passion I have right now, but it has only been my labor for 8 years. When I'm turning 40, 50 and 60 I still hope I have this passion in me. </p>  <p>The cool thing about Unclebob is that he does not only talk the talk, but he also walk the walk. A couple of days ago he published a video where he is doing a <a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/?p=71" target="_blank">Prime Factors Kata in Ruby</a>. In this video you'll see mastery of programming. Watch it and enjoy!</p>  <p><object width="504" height="400"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7762511&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7762511&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="504" height="400"></embed></object></p>  <p>I hope I someday can become a master software craftsman like Unclebob. Right now I'm still on my journey.</p>  <p>Read more about coding Katas on Unclebob’s <a href="http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/11/21/whats-all-this-nonsense-about-katas" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
