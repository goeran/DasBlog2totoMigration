      <Content>&lt;p&gt;During the MSDN Live event this September I got to know B&amp;#248;rge Hansen, which works as an Architect advisor for Microsoft Norge. He is a great guy and a software developer at heart. I&amp;#8217;ve not known him for a long time, but I&amp;#8217;ve already had some really good conversations with him regarding problems around software development and architecture. I think B&amp;#248;rge is going to make a difference for the Norwegian Architect community in the near future. So dear reader, if you are interest in software architecture please visit his blog: &lt;a href="http://www.borge3000.no" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.borge3000.no&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am a softwaredeveloper at heart, and my job is to work with and contribute to helping devs and architects to do a better job, do not hesitate to get in touch.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; B&amp;#248;rge Hansen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</Content>
